### 🏠 [Homepage](https://holium.org/)

## Project goal

The Holium Improvement Proposals repository is meant to create a space where potential users and the Holium community can
discuss future standards for the protocol.

## Validation

HIPs must pass some validation tests. The HIP repository ensures this by running tests using
[hip-validator](https://github.com/polyphene/hip-validator).
