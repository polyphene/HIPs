Abstract

<Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version
of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification
does.>

Motivation

<The motivation section should describe the "why" of this HIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to
implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the Holium ecosystem? What use cases does this HIP address?>

Specification

<The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be 
detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations of the Holium Framework.>

Rationale

<The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions
were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported
in other languages.>

Backwards Compatibility

<All HIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their
severity. The HIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. HIP submissions without a 
sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.>

Test Cases

<HIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.>

Reference Implementation

<An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or 
implementing this specification. If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider 
adding it as one or more files in HIPs/hip-####/.>

Security Considerations

<An optional section that contains the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include 
information that might be important for security discussions and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. 
E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and 
pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed.>
